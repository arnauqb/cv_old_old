	abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) line driven winds may be an important part of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback process, but understanding their impact is hindered by the complex nature of the radiation hydrodynamics. Instead, we have taken the approach pioneered by Risaliti \& Elvis, calculating only ballistic trajectories from radiation forces and gravity, but neglecting gas pressure. We have completely re-written their QWIND code using more robust algorithms, and can now quickly model the acceleration phase of these winds for any AGN spectral energy distribution spanning UV and X-ray wavebands. We demonstrate the code using an AGN with black hole mass \$10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ emitting at half the Eddington rate and show that this can effectively eject a wind with velocities \${\textbackslash}simeq (0.1-0.2){\textbackslash}, c\$. The mass loss rates can be up to \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.3 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ per year, consistent with more computationally expensive hydrodynamical simulations, though we highlight the importance of future improvements in radiation transfer along the multiple different lines of sight illuminating the wind. The code is fully public, and can be used to quickly explore the conditions under which AGN feedback can be dominated by accretion disc winds.},

	abstract = {When the gravitational lensing of the large-scale structure is calculated from a cosmological model a few assumptions enter: (i) one assumes that the photons follow unperturbed background geodesics, which is usually referred to as the Born approximation, (ii) the lenses move slowly, (iii) the source-redshift distribution is evaluated relative to the background quantities, and (iv) the lensing effect is linear in the gravitational potential. Even though these approximations are small individually they could sum up, especially since they include local effects such as the Sachs–Wolfe and peculiar motion, but also non-local ones like the Born approximation and the integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect. In this work, we will address all points mentioned and perturbatively calculate the effect on a tomographic cosmic shear power spectrum of each effect individually as well as all cross-correlations. Our findings show that each effect is at least 4–5 orders of magnitude below the leading order lensing signal. Finally, we sum up all effects to estimate the overall impact on parameter estimation by a future cosmological weak-lensing survey such as Euclid in a wcold dark matter cosmology with parametrization Ωm, σ8, ns, h, w0, and wa, using five tomographic bins. We consistently find a parameter bias of 10−5, which is therefore completely negligible for all practical purposes, confirming that other effects such as intrinsic alignments, magnification bias and uncertainties in the redshift distribution will be the dominant systematic source in future surveys.},

Interactions between individuals are modelled in groups of various sizes and properties, such as households, schools and workplaces, and other social activities using social mixing matrices. June provides a suite of flexible parametrizations that describe infectious diseases, how they are transmitted and affect contaminated individuals. In this paper, we apply June to the specific case of modelling the spread of COVID-19 in England. We discuss the quality of initial model outputs which reproduce reported hospital admission and mortality statistics at national and regional levels as well as by age strata.},

We apply a machine learning approach to this problem, presenting an end-to-end solution which results in robust and efficient inference. Since medical institutions often do not have the resources to process and label the large quantity of X-Ray images usually needed for neural network training, we design an end-to-end solution for small datasets, while achieving state-of-the-art results. Our implementation produces an overall accuracy of 92\%, F1 score of 0.92, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing classical image processing techniques, such as clustering and entropy based methods, while improving upon the output of existing neural networks used for segmentation in non-medical contexts.

	abstract = {The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the world’s most vulnerable populations most affected. Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions can be used to mitigate transmission, and modeling efforts can provide crucial insights on the potential effectiveness of such interventions to help inform decision making processes. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements. The model, based on the JUNE open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics tool which allows decision makers to distill insights by comparing the results of different simulations and scenarios. Through simulating their effects on the epidemiological development of COVID-19, we evaluate several public health interventions ranging from increasing mask wearing compliance to the reopening of learning institutions. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Cox’s Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings.},

	abstract = {With high levels of the Delta variant of COVID-19 circulating in England during September 2021, schools are set to reopen with few school-based non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In this paper, we present simulation results obtained from the individual-based model, JUNE, for school opening after a prior vaccination campaign using an optimistic set of assumptions about vaccine efficacy and the likelihood of prior-reinfection. We take a scenario-based approach to modelling potential interventions to assess relative changes rather than real-world forecasts. Specifically, we assess the effects of vaccinating those aged 16-17, those aged 12-17, and not vaccinating children at all relative to only vaccinating the adult population. Vaccinating children in the 12-15 age group would have had a significant impact on the course of the epidemic, saving thousands of lives overall in these simulations. In the absence of such a vaccination campaign our simulations show there could still be a significant positive impact on the epidemic (fewer cases, fewer deaths) by continuing NPI strategies in schools. Our analysis suggests that the best results are likely derived from a combination of vaccinations and NPIs.},
